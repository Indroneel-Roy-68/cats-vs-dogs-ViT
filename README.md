# Vision Transformer for Cats vs Dogs Classification

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates binary image classification using a Vision Transformer (ViT) model to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained and tested on the popular Cats vs Dogs dataset from Kaggle.

ViT is particularly well-suited for this task as it leverages the Transformer architecture to capture complex relationships between image pixels.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats/data** Dataset from Kaggle. It contains 25,000 labeled images (12,500 cats and 12,500 dogs).
